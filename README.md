## Peer Feedback
**David Wang - May 17, 2022**
*(did not play the game, only viewed gameplay)* 

The game pixel art and animation looked high-quality.

**Jackson Haught - May 23, 2022**

It was hard to move around in the game without getting hit by the enemies. Jackson found the game difficult since he could not regain health. 
- Changes: added a method to gain health and reduced speed of enemy projectiles.

**Dylan Hsueh - May 25, 2022**

It was unclear how to move in the game and fight enemies. Dylan tried to use arrow keys at first. The level was also hard since he was not able to regain health.
- Changes: added method of gaining health and tutorial on the first level to demonstrate movement.
